    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>These aren't pretty, but they are delicious. Serve with a salad for a great meal! You can freeze them for a quick dinner, but hide them or your family will eat them up!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
            <li>½ cup chopped onion</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>  
            <li>1 ½ cups barbeque sauce</li>
            <li>1 (10 ounce) package refrigerated biscuit dough</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease 8 muffin cups.</li>
            <li>In a large skillet or frying pan, cook ground chuck with onion and garlic powder until evenly brown; drain off the grease. Stir in the barbeque sauce and simmer for another 3 minutes.</li>
            <li>Roll out each biscuit on a floured surface so that each biscuit is 6 inches across. Put the biscuit in the muffin tin and fold up sides to create a cup shape. Fill each biscuit fill almost to the top with the meat mixture; top with cheddar cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven until biscuits are baked, cheese is melted and tops are golden brown, about 15 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
